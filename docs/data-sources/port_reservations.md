# ixapi_port_reservations (Data Source)

Use this data source to query for port reservations. Use the `ixapi_port_reservation` resource to reference and change port reservations of a connection. You can use the `ixapi_port_reservation` **resource** to import a port reservation, from a connection by passing a `port_num`. In most cases you will most likely use the port reservation resource instead of the data source.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "ixapi_port_reservations" "fra1" {
  network_connection = resource.ixapi_connection.fra1.id
}
```
