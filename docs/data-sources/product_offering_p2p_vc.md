- `handover_metro_area_network` (String) Id of the `MetroAreaNetwork`. The service will be accessed through the handover metro area network.  In case of a `p2p_vc`, the `handover_metro_area_network` refers to the A-side of the point-to-point connection. The A-side is the entity which initiates the network service creation.
