### Required

- `billing_account` (String) An account requires billing_information to be used as a `billing_account`. *(Sensitive Property)*
- `cloud_vlan` (Number) If the `provider_vlans` property of the `ProductOffering` is `multi`, a numeric value refers to a specific vlan on the service provider side.  Otherwise, if set to `null`, it refers to all unmatched vlan ids on the service provider side. (All vlan ids from the service provider side are presented as tags within any vlans specified in `vlan_config`.)  If the `provider_vlans` property of the `ProductOffering` is `single`, the `cloud_vlan` MUST be `null` or MUST NOT be provided.
- `consuming_account` (String) The `id` of the account consuming a service.  Used to be `owning_customer`.
- `handover` (Number) The handover enumerates the connection and is required for checking diversity constraints.  It must be within `1 <= x <= network_service.diversity`.
- `managing_account` (String) The `id` of the account responsible for managing the service via the API. A manager can read and update the state of entities.
- `network_connection` (String) The id of the connection to use for this `NetworkServiceConfig`.
- `network_service` (String) The id of the configured network service.

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--vlan_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `vlan_config`

Required:

- `vlan_type` (String) The vlan_type determines if a additional configuration is required: For `port` no configuration is required, `qinq` and `dot1q` require the config specific fields to be set.

Optional:

- `inner_vlan` (Number) ID of the inner VLan. Only required with QinQ vlan type.
- `outer_vlan` (Number) ID of ther outer VLAN. If not present, the IXP will select a valid ID. Only required for vlan type QinQ.
- `outer_vlan_ethertype` (String) Outer vlan ether type, defaults to: 0x8100. Only used with type QinQ.
- `vlan` (Number) A VLAN tag. If not present, the IXP will auto-select a valid vlan-id. Only used with VLAN type Dot1Q.
- `vlan_ethertype` (String) VLAN ether type, defaults to: 0x8100. Only used with type Dot1Q.


<a id="nestedblock--status"></a>
### Nested Schema for `status`

Optional:

- `message` (String) A human readable message, describing the problem and may contain hints for resolution.
- `severity` (Number) We are using syslog severity levels: 0 = Emergency, 1 = Alert, 2 = Critical, 3 = Error, 4 = Warning, 5 = Notice, 6 = Informational, 7 = Debug.
