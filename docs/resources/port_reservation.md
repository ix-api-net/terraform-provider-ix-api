# ixapi_port_reservation (Resource)

Use the `ixapi_port_reservation` resource to manage port reservations for a connection. You can create a new port reservation by only passing the `connection` to the resource, or you can reference an already allocated port reservation, which was created when the connection was allocated, by specifying a `port_num` (starting at 1).
