<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `billing_account` (String) An account requires billing_information to be used as a `billing_account`. *(Sensitive Property)*
- `cloud_key` (String)
- `consuming_account` (String) The `id` of the account consuming a service.  Used to be `owning_customer`.
- `managing_account` (String) The `id` of the account responsible for managing the service via the API. A manager can read and update the state of entities.
- `product_offering` (String)

### Optional

- `capacity` (Number) The capacity of the service in Mbps. When null, the maximum capacity will be used.
- `charged_until` (String) The service continues incurring charges until this date. Typically `â‰¥ decommission_at`.  This field is only used when the state is `DECOMMISSION_REQUESTED` or `DECOMMISSIONED`.  *(Sensitive Property)*
- `contract_ref` (String) A reference to a contract. If no specific contract is used, a default MAY be chosen by the implementer. *(Sensitive Property)*
- `current_billing_start_date` (String) Your obligation to pay for the service will start on this date.  However, this date may change after an upgrade and not reflect the inital start date of the service.  *(Sensitive Property)*
- `decommission_at` (String) The service will be decommissioned on this date.  This field is only used when the state is `DECOMMISSION_REQUESTED` or `DECOMMISSIONED`.
- `diversity` (Number) Same value as the corresponding `ProductOffering`.  The service can be delivered over multiple handovers from the exchange to the `service_provider`.  The `diversity` denotes the number of handovers between the exchange and the service provider. A value of two signals a redundant service.  Only one network service configuration for each `handover` and `cloud_vlan` can be created.
- `external_ref` (String) Reference field, free to use for the API user. *(Sensitive Property)*
- `nsc_required_contact_roles` (List of String)
- `provider_ref` (String) For a cloud network service with the exchange first workflow, the `provider_ref` will be a reference to a resource of the cloud provider. (E.g. the UUID of a virtual circuit.)  The `provider_ref` is managed by the exchange and its meaning may vary between different cloud services.
- `purchase_order` (String) Purchase Order ID which will be displayed on the invoice. *(Sensitive Property)*
- `state` (String)
- `status` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--status))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--status"></a>
### Nested Schema for `status`

Optional:

- `message` (String) A human readable message, describing the problem and may contain hints for resolution.
- `severity` (Number) We are using syslog severity levels: 0 = Emergency, 1 = Alert, 2 = Critical, 3 = Error, 4 = Warning, 5 = Notice, 6 = Informational, 7 = Debug.
- `tag` (String) A machine readable message identifier.
- `timestamp` (String) The time and date when the event occured.
